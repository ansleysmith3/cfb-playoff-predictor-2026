"""Build one row per (season, ranking week, team): that team's resume as of that moment.

Design rules
- NO LEAKAGE: a ranking labeled "week W" is released after week W-1's games, so only
  regular-season games from weeks <= W-1 are used. Postseason games are never used.
- RESUME ONLY: features come from game results and Elo ratings. Human polls (AP, Coaches)
  are kept as `ref_*` columns for comparison but must not be used as model inputs.
- NO TEAM NAMES as inputs: the model should learn how the committee turns a resume into
  a ranking, not "Alabama is usually good".

Writes data/features/features_<year>.csv

Usage:
    python -m src.features --years 2014-2026
